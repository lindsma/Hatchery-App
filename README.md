## Week 8

** Note: Please load unsafe scripts for the Weather Underground API

#### Objective:
Utilize the following languages/tools to make an app of your choice: 
* An agile Trello board with user stories
* An Angular JS framework
* Connect with at least one API to make GET and POST requests
* Separate Sass into partials, mixins, and variables
* Responsive Design
* User Interface - Ensure the project has a cohesive, clean design
* Leverage jQuery for DOM manipulation

Hatchery was created to simplify and organize the ordering process for a classmate's farm-fresh eggs. We utilized the Weather Underground API to include a fun feature where users can see current weather conditions of Durham, NC, where their tasty eggs are being produced.
